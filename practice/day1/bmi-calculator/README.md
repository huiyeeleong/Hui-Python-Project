## BMI Calculator 2.0

# Instructions

Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

- Under 18.5 they are underweight
- Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
- Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
- Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
- Above 35 they are clinically obese.



The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):





# Example Input

```
weight = 85
```

```
height = 1.75
```

# Example Output

85 ÷ (1.75 x 1.75) =  27.755102040816325

```
Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight.
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

The testing code will check for print output that is formatted like one of the lines below:

```
"Your BMI is 18, you are underweight."
"Your BMI is 22, you have a normal weight."
"Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight."
"Your BMI is 33, you are obese."
"Your BMI is 40, you are clinically obese."
```
