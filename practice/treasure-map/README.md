## Treasure Map

!In the starting code, you will find a variable called ```map```.

This ```map``` contains a nested list.
When ```map``` is printed this is what the nested list looks like:
```
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
```
In the starting code, we have used new lines (```\n```) to format the three rows into a square, like this:
```
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
```

First your program must take the user input and convert it to a usable format. 

Next, you need to use it to update your nested list with an "x". 

# Example Input 1

column 2, row 3 would be entered as:

```
23
```

# Example Output 1

```
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', 'X', '⬜️']
```

# Example Input 2

column 3, row 1 would be entered as:

```
31
```

# Example Output 2

```
['⬜️', '⬜️', 'X']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:
